          <p className="leading-[40px] text-xl">
            One of the cornerstones of modern cybersecurity is incident
            response. This concept describes how cybersecurity professionals
            respond to security breaches or other compromising incidents in
            their networks. Effective incident response requires constant
            training on the latest threats, tools, and techniques for combatting
            digital attacks. Modern cybersecurity is a requirement in the
            digital age, but many organizations' internal IT security
            departments do not have the training, resources, or manpower to
            fight sophisticated cyberattacks.
